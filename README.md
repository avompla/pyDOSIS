# pyDOSIS
An open source dosimetry calculation system for applications in nuclear medicine procedures.

This project will try to realize a python code able to perform 3D dosimetric calculations for nuclear medicine applications by means of patient-specific data provided by dual imaging techniques like PET-CT or SPECT-CT.

It will be written in python as well as it will be possible and it will use some MC simulation code, like MCNP or FLUKA, when a particle transportation and dose delivery will be necessary.

It is desirable to develope at the end, a user-friendly GUI with the aim of allow the code testing by non developing users.
